### Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋

I'm a passionate and driven Data Scientist 👩‍💻 with a focus on data analysis, machine learning, Python and building robust data sience pipelines. Here, you'll find a collection of my projects and contributions that showcase my skills and expertise in various areas of programming, data science, data analysis, web scraping, computer vision, recommender systems, reinforcement learning.

I believe in the power of collaboration 👯 and open-source development. All of my projects are hosted here, offering insights into my problem-solving approach, coding style, and ability to work with different programming languages (Python and SQL) and frameworks (e.g. OOP). I strive to create clean, efficient, and well-documented code that adheres to industry best practices.

I am constantly exploring new technologies and staying updated with the latest advancements in the field 🔭.

Currently, I am working on training a drone 🛸 with a Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning model which would map and scan objects as it travels through a given environment. I am also learning 🌱 more SQL, cloud computing, Tablaeu and Computer vision.

Feel free to explore my repositories, contribute to ongoing projects, or get inspired for your own endeavors. I welcome feedback, discussions, and collaborations, so don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or ideas 💬.

⚡ Other than Python and Machine Learning, I have a new found passion for gardening and growing my own vegetables. I believe a balance is essential in harvesting the most out of every moment, to which regard, I spent a lot of time exploring different parts of the world, volunteering at people welfare organisations and bettering my ability to listen first and talk later or less.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile, and I look forward to connecting with fellow data enthusiasts like you.

Let's build something amazing together 👯
